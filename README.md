# CRUD_Node_Handlebars

CRUD logic with Node and Handlebars

This application is intended to serve as a cheat sheet, with minimal functionality implemented to complete the CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) logic. NodedJS will be in charge for the logic, MySQL to store data (MAMP to connect us to MySQL, Sequel Pro to display it), and Handlebars to serve our HTML page with the data from the Database.

To start this application open your app in the terminal with "nodemon app.js" command and go to the localhost 3700
